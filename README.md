# Cardboard Controls+

Cardboard Controls+ is all you need to develop the best Cardboard games in Unity. These scripts enhance [the Google VR SDK for Unity](https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/) with event-driven improvements for discrete trigger control, orientation tilting, gaze raycasting, and reticle control. Stop limiting your creative options!

See the [package directory](Assets/CardboardControl) for details.

See the [examples directory](Assets/CardboardControl/DemoScenes) for thorough documentation.
